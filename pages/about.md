    <h2>Who?</h2>
    <p>
      You can find my occasionally updated blog
      <a href="https:/williampickup.org/blog">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I live on <a href="">Sydneys' Northern Beaches</a>, where I enjoy and
      <a href="">running</a>, <a href="">swimming</a>, and
      <a href="">slowly making things in my workshop</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continue to be interested in <a href="https://blog.williampickup.org/categories/#music">music</a>, alternative lifestyles and technology which have been with me since high school in the 1970's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years I have been an <a href="https://blog.williampickup.org/the-franklin-river-campaign-25-years-on/">environmental activist</a>, natural therapist and ended spending most of my working life in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williampickup/">IT</a>
