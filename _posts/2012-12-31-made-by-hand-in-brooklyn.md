[Made by Hand][thisismadebyhand] is a project creating beautiful videos that celebrate the resurgent maker scene in Brooklyn. Also see this [page][keef-tv].

> "...Made by Hand was created out of the belief that the things we collect, consume, use, and share are part of who we are as individuals. For example, the food that we eat says something about each of us, as do the tools we use and the chairs we rest on. Objects that surround the space we dwell in tell stories, and not just about us. Where did they come from? Who made them? How were they made? "

The video below features knife maker Joel Bukiewicz reflecting on how he got started and the challenging process of learning the skills. The black and white style complements the material.

> "...You go into the shop and you cut yourself burn yourself, f..k something up...and you never make that mistake again..".
